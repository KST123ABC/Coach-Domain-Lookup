# mlh-coach-domain-lookup

Batch registrar lookup for coaches to check for Domain.com registration

## Instructions

1. To run the command, type the following into your terminal in the directory the script is in `./lookup.sh`
2. Type in the name of the domains followed by the enter key `example.com example2.com example3.com`
3. Analyze results.

## Troubleshooting

#### If it hangs...

Your network is blocking the traffic from whois requests. Using a different network is your best bet.

#### If all results say "NO!"...

Odds are you have been IP banned from the server for making too many requests. Try to submit your requests once per domain. Run the script the minimum amount of times required to get the answers you need.
